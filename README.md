# Parking-space-project
 
Overview:

Car Parking Space Detection is a computer vision project that automates the process of identifying vacant parking spaces in a car park. It utilizes image processing techniques to analyze a car park video feed and provide real-time information about available parking spaces.

Key Features:

Automated Parking Space Detection: The main script, main.py, processes the car park video, identifies vacant parking spaces, and displays the results in real-time. It uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video frames and determine the status of each parking space.

Manual Space Definition: The ParkingSpacePicker.py script allows users to interactively define parking space positions by clicking on the image. The defined positions are saved for later use by the main script.

Visualization: The project provides visual feedback, highlighting vacant parking spaces in green and occupied spaces in red within the video feed. Additionally, it displays the number of vacant spaces and their locations.
